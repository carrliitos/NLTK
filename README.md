# Named Entity Recognition with NLTK and SpaCy

Named entity recognition (NER)is probably the first step towards information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such 
as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. NER is used in many fields in Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
and it can help answering many real-world questions, such as:

- Which companies were mentioned in the news article?
- Were specified products mentioned in complaints or reviews?
- Does the tweet contain the name of a person? Does the tweet contain this personâ€™s location?
